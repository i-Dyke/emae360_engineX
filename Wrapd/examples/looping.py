## Example 1: Using DataCollector objects (Recommended)
print("Running Data Collector Case")

plt.title("Collector Pressure vs Temperature")
plt.xlabel("Pressure (psi)")
plt.ylabel("Chamber Temperature (K)")
plt.show()


## Example 2: Using standard python arrays
print("Running Python Array Case")

temperatures = []
for pressure in pressures:
  problem.set_pressure(pressure)

plt.plot(pressures, temperatures)
plt.title("Python Arrays Pressure vs Temperature")
plt.xlabel("Pressure (psi)")
plt.ylabel("Chamber Temperature (K)")
plt.show()


## Example 3: Using numpy arrays
print("Running Numpy Array Case")
arr_size = 25 # 25 runs of CEA
pressures = np.linspace(1000, 2000, arr_size) # pressures from 1000 to 2000

for i, pressure in enumerate(pressures):
  problem.set_pressure(pressure)
  data = problem.run()
  temperatures[i] = data.c_t # set current chamber temperature

plt.plot(pressures, temperatures)
plt.title("Numpy Pressure vs Temperature")
plt.xlabel("Pressure (psi)")

## Example 4: Terrible no good using numpy arrays to get all your properties
print("Running terrible Numpy Array Case")
arr_size = 30 # runs of CEA
pressures = np.linspace(1000, 2000, arr_size) # pressures from 1000 to 2000

## Example 5: Using the awesome DataCollector objects to make your life easy
print("Running the awesome super cool Data Collector Case")
pressures = np.linspace(1000, 2000, 30) # pressures from 1000 to 2000
# Define a collector to collect all these properties. Also get composition at the exit for these product species
#   If you wanted to define keys for the chamber, use "chamber_keys" instead
#   NOTE: You cannot have chamber and exit keys in the same collector. If you want both, use multiple collectors
collector = DataCollector("c_t", "ivac", "cf", "gamma", "cstar", "mach", "cp", "c_cp", exit_keys=["HCL", "AL2O3(L)"])
for pressure in pressures:
  problem.set_pressure(pressure)
  collector.add_data(problem.run()) # adds all desired variables to collector
# And that's it! Now we can access our array of chamber temperatures with
collector.c_t
# And our mol_ratios of HCL in the exhaust with
collector.HCL
# The really cool thing is that we don't need to worry about species not existing, because they will automatically be
#   set to 0 in the correct position of the array
# Fun thing! You can also write your collectors to csv
collector.to_csv("looper.csv")


## Example 6: Varying ratios of materials
print("Running various aluminum contents (may take a bit)")
percent_aluminum = np.linspace(0, 25, 250) # run percentage of aluminum from 0% to 15%
# reminder: 12% HTPB, and we'll reduce the amount of AP to compensate
collector = DataCollector("c_t", "ivac") # Show chamber temperature and isp dependence on % aluminum

startTime = time()
for al_percent in percent_aluminum:
  aluminum.set_wt_percent(al_percent)
  # NOTE: CEA doesn't like it when a material has 0%, so at 0% the material is not entered into the .inp file
  ap.set_wt_percent(100-12-al_percent)
  problem.set_absolute_o_f() # change our o/f to reflect situation
  collector.add_data(problem.run())
endTime = time()
print("Completed in {}s! {} CEA calls per second".format(endTime-startTime, 250/(endTime-startTime)))
